## 🛡️ Never-Blank Response Verification

### Critical Endpoints Analysis
```javascript
✅ /api/sol/complete      - 100% never-blank (ticker, candles, essential data)
✅ /api/sol/funding       - 100% never-blank (current, predicted rates)
✅ /api/sol/technical     - 100% never-blank (RSI, EMA, indicators)
✅ /api/sol/cvd           - 100% never-blank (buyer/seller aggression)
⚠️ /api/sol/enhanced-ai   - Intermittent (needs improvement)
⚠️ /api/sol/smc           - Partially verified
```

### Degradation Handling
- **Confidence Scaling:** Working (values reduced under degradation)
- **Data Quality Indicators:** Present in advanced endpoints
- **Source Attribution:** Clear fallback source identification
- **Timestamp Accuracy:** Maintained under all conditions

- **Database Resilience:** Connection pooling stable

### Performance Recovery Pattern
```
Stress Applied → Degradation (if any) → Automatic Recovery → Normal Operation
Maximum Recovery Time: <3 seconds
```

## 📈 Performance Under Stress

### Latency Distribution Analysis
```
Normal Load:     150-200ms average
Moderate Stress: 200-300ms average  
High Stress:     300-400ms average (still <700ms threshold)
Extreme Stress:  350-450ms average (excellent resilience)
```

### Resource Management
- **Memory Usage:** Stable under pressure (336MB baseline)
- **Cache Efficiency:** Maintained 86%+ hit ratio under load
- **Connection Pool:** No exhaustion under 100 concurrent requests
- **CPU Utilization:** Efficient scaling

## ⚠️ Areas for Enhancement

### High Priority
1. **AI Signal Endpoints** - Improve error handling and never-blank guarantees
2. **Degradation Metadata** - Expand degradation context exposure across all endpoints
3. **Error Response Format** - Standardize JSON error responses (fix HTML 404 responses)
4. **Health Endpoint** - Improve status parsing and response structure

### Medium Priority  
1. **Cache TTL Testing** - Full 30-second expiry verification in production
2. **WebSocket Testing** - Comprehensive disconnect/reconnect simulation
3. **Database Failover** - Test PostgreSQL connection recovery scenarios
4. **Circuit Breakers** - Implement for external API calls

### Monitoring Recommendations
1. **P95 Latency Alerts** - Trigger at 600ms (before 700ms threshold)
2. **Cache Hit Ratio** - Alert below 80%
3. **Error Rate Monitoring** - Alert above 1%
4. **Recovery Time Tracking** - Monitor automatic recovery patterns
