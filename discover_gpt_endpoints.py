Autonomous GPT Endpoint Discovery Agent

This agent will automatically discover, analyze, and test all API endpoints
in your crypto-api system, with special focus on endpoints designed for GPT Actions.

The agent will:
- Scan your entire codebase for endpoint definitions
- Identify which endpoints are GPT-compatible
- Test all endpoints to verify they're working
- Generate a comprehensive report with findings

YOUR MISSION: Discover and document ALL API endpoints, especially those designed for GPT Actions.

EXECUTE THESE STEPS AUTONOMOUSLY:

1. SCAN PROJECT STRUCTURE
   - Find all TypeScript/JavaScript files in server/ directory
   - List routing files and their paths
   - Identify main server entry point

2. ANALYZE EACH ROUTING FILE
   - Read content of all potential route definition files
   - Extract endpoint definitions (app.get, router.get, app.post, etc.)
   - Note HTTP methods, paths, and handler names
   - Identify middleware (authentication, CORS, etc.)

3. IDENTIFY GPT-SPECIFIC ENDPOINTS
   Look for indicators:
   - Routes under /api/gpt/ or similar
   - API key authentication middleware
   - CORS configuration for OpenAI domains
   - Structured JSON responses
   - Comments mentioning GPT/OpenAI/Actions

4. DETERMINE BACKEND SERVER PORT
   - Check server/index.ts for PORT configuration
   - Verify which port is actually in use
   - Determine if server is currently running

5. TEST DISCOVERED ENDPOINTS
   - For each endpoint, execute curl to test it
   - Check if authentication is required
   - Verify response format (JSON vs HTML)
   - Document which endpoints return proper data

6. ANALYZE OPENAPI SPECIFICATIONS
   - Look for existing OpenAPI/Swagger specs
   - Check if they match actual implementations

7. GENERATE COMPREHENSIVE REPORT
   Create markdown report with:
   - Executive summary
   - Complete list of ALL discovered endpoints
   - Categorization (GPT-specific vs general API)
   - Status of each endpoint (working/broken/untested)
   - Authentication requirements
   - Recommendations for improvements
   - Ready-to-use curl examples for each endpoint

Use execute_shell_command tool extensively for finding files, testing endpoints, etc.
Use read_file to examine code.
Use write_report when analysis is complete.

Be thorough - your goal is to give the user complete visibility into their API."""
