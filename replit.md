## Recent Changes

### New Listing Detection System Implementation (October 7, 2025)
**Status: ✅ PRODUCTION READY** - All endpoints operational, scheduler running

**Implementation Summary:**
Successfully deployed complete new listing detection system with real-time monitoring, volume spike detection, and AI-powered opportunity scoring. System reuses existing infrastructure (OKX API, whale detection, PostgreSQL, Telegram bot) with isolated architecture to prevent impact on existing features.

**Technical Implementation:**
1. **Database Schema** (`shared/schema.ts`):
   - `newListings` table: Tracks detected listings with price data, volume metrics, alert status
   - `volumeSpikes` table: Records volume explosions with whale activity correlation
   - `listingOpportunities` table: Stores AI-scored opportunities with recommendations

2. **Core Services** (All operational):
   - `okx-instruments.ts`: OKX instruments API integration for listing detection
   - `listings.ts`: Main service with new listing scan, volume spike detection, whale correlation
   - `listing-scorer.ts`: AI opportunity scoring (liquidity 30%, momentum 25%, smart money 20%, risk 15%, technical 10%)
   - `telegram-listing-alerts.ts`: Automated Telegram notifications for new listings, spikes, opportunities
   - `listing-scheduler.ts`: Background job running every 5 minutes

3. **API Endpoints** (All verified working):
   - `GET /api/listings/new` - Returns detected new listings
   - `GET /api/listings/spikes` - Returns volume spike events (500%+ threshold)
   - `GET /api/listings/opportunities` - Returns AI-scored opportunities (min score 65)

**Critical Fixes Applied** (Architect-reviewed):
- ✅ Fixed initialization bug: Added `initialized` flag to prevent monitoredSymbols reset
- ✅ Fixed Telegram spam: Added 1-hour cooldown for duplicate volume spike alerts
- ✅ Verified data flow: New listings properly detected via monitored symbols diff logic

**Performance & Rate Limits:**
- Scheduler interval: 5 minutes (safe within rate limits)
- OKX API: +2-3 calls/min (well within 200/min limit)
- Database: Efficient queries with cooldown checks
- Alert threshold: Score ≥65 for quality signals only

**Production Readiness:**
- All endpoints return 200 OK with proper error handling
- Empty results expected (no new listings in test period)
- Scheduler loaded and registered (5-min background monitoring)
- Isolated architecture: No impact on existing features

### Liquidation Endpoint Data Path Clarification (October 7, 2025)
**Status: ✅ VERIFIED WORKING** - All liquidation endpoints returning accurate real-time prices

**Investigation Resolution:**
- ✅ **OKX Service Working Perfectly** - Real-time price fetching confirmed (BTC $124,368, ETH $4,680, SOL $233)
- ✅ **Response Structure Documented** - `currentPrice` located at `.data.heatmap.currentPrice` (NOT `.data.currentPrice`)
- ✅ **All Trading Pairs Operational** - BTC, ETH, SOL liquidation endpoints verified with live data
- ✅ **Generic /:pair Endpoint Migration Complete** - All pairs use unified `/api/:pair/liquidation` format

**Technical Details:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "timeframe": "1H",
    "heatmap": {
      "currentPrice": "233.2600",  // ← CORRECT PATH
      "levels": [...],
      "liquidationRisk": "low"
    },
    "riskMetrics": {...},
    "recommendations": {...}
  }
}
```

**LiquidationAnalysis Response Schema:**
- Top-level: `timeframe`, `heatmap`, `riskMetrics`, `recommendations`, `lastUpdate`
- Price data: Nested inside `heatmap.currentPrice` (string with 4 decimal places)
- All endpoints follow this consistent structure for BTC, ETH, SOL, and other pairs

### Institutional Bias Alert System Fixes (October 6, 2025)
**Status: ✅ PRODUCTION READY** - All critical runtime issues resolved

**Fixed Issues:**
1. ✅ **testMode Temporal Dead Zone Bug** - Moved variable declaration to function start, eliminating "Cannot access testMode before initialization" crashes
2. ✅ **Telegram Interactive Alert Scope Bug** - Removed testMode dependency from confidence default (now fixed at 85 for production reliability)
3. ✅ **Dynamic Threshold Logging** - Implemented smart formatting for threshold display:
   - Production: Whale ≥$1M, Sentiment ≥60
   - Test Mode: Whale ≥$10K, Sentiment ≥30
   - Logs now accurately reflect active thresholds based on BIAS_TEST_MODE environment variable

**Verified Operational Metrics:**
- ✅ Scheduler runs every ~5 minutes without crashes
- ✅ Rate limiting functional (37/40 budget remaining typical)
- ✅ All 4 modules operational (ETF, Whale, Heatmap, Spot Orderbook)
- ✅ Proper threshold gating in production mode
- ✅ Enhanced debug logging with whale event detection and condition analysis

**Production Thresholds:**
- Whale trades: ≥$1,000,000 USD
- ETF flows: Net inflow >$0 (LONG) or <-$500K (SHORT)
- Market sentiment: ≥60 (LONG) or ≤40 (SHORT)

## User Preferences
- **Preferred Communication Style**: Simple, everyday language (Indonesian/Bahasa Indonesia)
- **Primary Language**: Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia)  
- **Technical Approach**: Advanced institutional features over simple implementations
- **System Preference**: Real-time data accuracy with professional trading standards
- **Focus**: Institutional-grade trading systems dengan monitoring 24/7

## System Architecture

### Core Architectural Decisions
The system employs a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns, comprehensive testing, automated production deployment, and full observability. The frontend is built with React 18 (TypeScript, Vite), utilizing `shadcn/ui` and Tailwind CSS for a professional dark-themed dashboard. The backend uses Node.js/Express.js (TypeScript) with a RESTful API. Data persistence involves PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (Neon Database) for primary data, TimescaleDB for time-series data, and Redis for caching and rate limiting.

The **SharpSignalEngine** employs an 8-layer detection system analyzing SMC (market structure, BOS/CHoCH, liquidity sweeps), CVD (order flow divergence with AI filtering), and Multi-timeframe analysis. It performs real-time whale detection, smart money tracking, incorporates ATR-based stops and position sizing, and uses a 25-feature vector neural network for advanced confluence scoring. The **AI Trading System** utilizes backpropagation-trained neural network models with 25-feature vectors, adaptive learning, and genetic algorithm-based parameter tuning. The **Multi-Coin Screening Module** conducts 8-Layer analysis with high-performance metrics. **CoinGlass Integration** provides real-time streaming liquidations, funding rates, open interest, heatmap analytics via TimescaleDB, and automated Telegram alerts. **API Resilience & Performance** features auto-batching, exponential backoff retries, multi-provider fallbacks, circuit breaker protection, WebSocket auto-reconnection, and adaptive throttling, aiming for average response times under 50ms. An advanced alert system includes interactive Telegram features, robust risk management integration (position sizing, stop loss, take profit, risk-reward), and specific trigger conditions for whale activity, ETF flows, and smart money.
