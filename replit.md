## System Architecture

### Core Architectural Decisions
The system employs a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns, comprehensive testing, automated production deployment, and full observability. The frontend uses React 18 (TypeScript, Vite) with `shadcn/ui` and Tailwind CSS for a professional dark-themed dashboard. The backend utilizes Node.js/Express.js (TypeScript) with a RESTful API. Data persistence is managed with PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM (Neon Database) for primary data, TimescaleDB for time-series data, and Redis for caching and rate limiting.

### GPT Actions Integration
The system fully integrates GPT Actions, providing real-time institutional data through a multi-operation gateway (`/gpts/unified/advanced`). **OpenAPI schema updated (Oct 8, 2025)** to include all operations: `whale_alerts`, `whale_positions`, `etf_flows`, `market_sentiment`, `ticker`, `liquidation_heatmap`, **`alpha_screening`** (CoinMarketCap 4-layer alpha analysis with REAL-TIME prices from 300+ exchanges), **`new_listings`** (crypto new listings detection), **`volume_spikes`** (volume spikes with whale & order flow analysis), **`opportunities`** (AI-scored trading opportunities), **`micro_caps`** (micro-cap gems discovery with tokenomics scoring), and **`atr`** (real-time ATR volatility from OKX). **Latest schema fixes (Oct 8)**: Enhanced all 11 {pair} and {symbol} parameters with explicit descriptions ("Symbol only: BTC, ETH, SOL - NO suffix like -USDT-SWAP"), examples (BTC), and enum constraints (20 valid symbols) to prevent GPT format errors. Schema includes accurate response examples with live price data to prevent GPT hallucination. Covers over 100 cryptocurrencies with enhanced real-time monitoring and multi-exchange data aggregation.

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend features a modern, professional dark-themed dashboard using `shadcn/ui` and Tailwind CSS. Key UI components include an AI Signal Dashboard, CVD Analysis, Confluence Scoring, Liquidity Heatmap, Live Trading Signals, Multi-Coin Screener, and TradingView widget integration.

### Feature Specifications
The **SharpSignalEngine** employs an 8-layer detection system analyzing SMC, CVD, and Multi-timeframe analysis. It performs real-time whale detection, smart money tracking, incorporates ATR-based stops and position sizing, and uses a 25-feature vector neural network for advanced confluence scoring. The **AI Trading System** utilizes backpropagation-trained neural network models with adaptive learning and genetic algorithm-based parameter tuning. The **Multi-Coin Screening Module** conducts 8-Layer analysis with high-performance metrics. **CoinGlass Integration** provides real-time streaming liquidations, funding rates, open interest, and heatmap analytics. **API Resilience & Performance** features auto-batching, exponential backoff retries, multi-provider fallbacks, circuit breaker protection, WebSocket auto-reconnection, and adaptive throttling, aiming for average response times under 50ms. An advanced alert system includes interactive Telegram features and robust risk management integration. A **New Listing Detection System** provides real-time monitoring, volume spike detection, AI-powered opportunity scoring, and enhanced Telegram alerts with BUY/SHORT directional signals, analyzing buy/sell pressure, CVD, whale direction, and funding rates.

## Recent Changes (October 8, 2025)

### ✅ ATR Endpoint Real-Time Implementation
**Problem Solved**: ATR endpoint was using hardcoded stub data (BTC: 1.2%, SOL: 0.8%).

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **OKX API Integration** (`coinglass-system/app/main.py`):
   - Fetches real-time OHLC candles from OKX market API
   - Calculates True Range (TR) = max(H-L, |H-PC|, |L-PC|) for 14 periods
   - Returns ATR% = (ATR / current_price) * 100
   - Fallback to realistic estimates if OKX unavailable
2. **Database Connection Fix**:
   - Removed invalid `command_timeout` parameter (psycopg2 incompatible)
   - Changed to `options: "-c statement_timeout=30000"` for timeout control
3. **Real-Time Results**:
   - BTC ATR: 0.65% (from 15 OKX candles)
   - ETH ATR: 1.11% (current price: $4,457)
   - SOL ATR: 1.23% (current price: $219)
   - Status: `"real-time"` with `"source": "OKX"`

### ✅ OpenAPI Schema Parameter Enhancement
**Problem Solved**: GPT Actions sending wrong format (BTC-USDT-SWAP instead of BTC).

**Solution Implemented** (`public/openapi-gpts-final.yaml`):
1. **Enhanced 11 Parameters** ({pair} and {symbol}):
   - Added explicit descriptions: "Symbol only: BTC, ETH, SOL (NO suffix like -USDT-SWAP)"
   - Added examples: `example: BTC`
   - Added enum constraints: `enum: [BTC, ETH, SOL, ADA, AVAX, ...]` (20 valid symbols)
2. **Parameter Coverage**:
   - 6 {pair} parameters: `/api/{pair}/complete`, `/api/{pair}/smc`, etc.
   - 5 {symbol} parameters: `/py/advanced/technical/atr`, `/py/advanced/ticker/{symbol}`, etc.
3. **Validation Complete**:
   - All 33 object schemas have `properties: {}`
   - File size: 14KB (optimized)
   - Total operations: 30 (GPT Actions limit compliant)

### 🔄 Known Issues (Non-Critical)
1. **CoinGlass Liquidation Heatmap Empty**:
   - Root cause: CoinGlass API feed consolidation/latency
   - Logs show: "GUARDRAILS: Empty data detected" → fallback attempts fail
   - Status: External API issue, system handles gracefully with fallbacks
2. **Enhanced AI Signal Error 500** (ETH):
   - Not visible in recent logs (likely resolved/transient)
   - Neural engine recalibration phase completed
   - Status: Monitoring for recurrence
